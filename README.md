# Tailwindcss Plugin Conflict
This repository demonstrates a bug caused by a conflict between Tailwind CSS plugins.  The bug results in unexpected styling issues when utilizing plugin-defined classes.

## Bug Description
When integrating a plugin that modifies Tailwind's configuration, certain plugin-specific styles might not apply correctly. This often happens due to order-of-operations issues in the plugin loading sequence or misconfiguration within the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
3. Try to run the application (if applicable) or inspect the generated CSS for missing styles.
4. Observe the styling issues caused by the conflicting plugin.

## Solution
The solution to this problem involves carefully reviewing the Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`), plugin integration documentation and ordering of plugins to ensure proper style application. Consider using the `plugins` array within the config to specify plugin order and resolve any merge conflicts between plugin configurations.
